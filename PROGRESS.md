# Fleetex Reimplementation — Progress Log

> Update this at the end of every session. Keep it short. The next session reads
> **only this file + ROADMAP.md** to get oriented — cheap context, no source re-reads.

## Current status
- **Launcher (v0.1.1):** shipped — runs the real Node Overleaf via Docker. ✅
- **Python reimplementation:** NOT STARTED. Next step = Phase 0 (foundations).

## Next session should do
Phase 0, task 1: create the `fleetex/services/` layout and a shared
`fleetex-service-kit` (config, logging, Mongo/Redis clients, health endpoint).
Nothing else. Commit when done.

## Services ported (Node → Python)
_(none yet)_

## Gotchas / decisions log
- Frontend stays JS/TS (React); we reuse Overleaf's. Only backends go to Python.
- Reference the Node source in the sibling repo at `/data3/overleaf/services/<name>`.
